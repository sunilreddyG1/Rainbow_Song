Red and yellow and pink and green
Purple and orange and blue
I can sing a rainbow,
sing a rainbow,
sing a rainbow too.

Listen with your eyes,
Listen with your ears,
and sing everything you see,
I can sing a rainbow,
sing a rainbow,
sing along with me.

They say oh my god I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time



When up swam a fish with a children's book thought that I was lost. 
Saw me sitting on this log and thought I'd like to read. You just sit 
ike a bump on the log and call that fish your pal. They never caught me! 
All want me for their own. While I slept in children's dreams, the fish ran away with the moon. 
The fish ran away with the moon.


I go new movie please add my all songs to rainbow album
